fsipd - Fake SIP Daemon

fsipd is a minimal SIP honeypot. It listens on TCP/UDP 5060 and logs all incoming SIP requests along with SRC/DST Source and Port in CSV format or syslog.

NOTE: This program depends on [libpidutil](https://github.com/farrokhi/libpidutil)

WARNING: This is a work in progress.
